This project is part of the National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Health Initiative. Soil health is the ongoing ability of soil to function as a living ecosystem for soil organisms and perform ecosystem services, and is assessed in this project using a combination of several dynamic soil properties. The goal of the project is to assess soil health in the Willamette Valley using two representative types of soil in multiples management systems. In particular, we are interested in Woodburn soil and Jory soil. We are also interested in comparing till vs no-till agriculture and Christmas tree farms vs a vineyards vs a natural forest for the two soils, respectively. To this end, our research questions are, “how does the health of a Woodburn soil differ between a tilled agricultural system, an untilled agricultural system,” and “how does the health of a Jory soil differ between a vineyard, a Christmas tree farm, and a natural forest setting?"
