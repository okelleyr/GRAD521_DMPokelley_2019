# Data description

My project is part of the National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Health Initiative. Soil health is the ongoing ability of soil to function as an ecosystem for soil organisms and perform ecosystem services, and is assessed using a combination of several dynamic soil properties. The goal of the project is to assess soil health in the Willamette Valley using two representative types of soil in multiples management systems. In particular, we are interested in Woodburn soil and Jory soil. We are also interested in comparing till vs no-till agriculture and Christmas tree farms vs a vineyards vs a natural forest for the two soils, respectively. To this end, our research questions are, “how does the health of a Woodburn soil differ between a tilled agricultural system, an untilled agricultural system,” and “how does the health of a Jory soil differ between a vineyard, a Christmas tree farm, and a natural forest setting?”

Soil health is a holistic concept that encompasses a combination of several different dynamic soil properties (DSPs). The specific DSPs used vary among research groups, but we will be using those recommended by NRCS. In the lab, we will measure soil organic carbon, wet aggregate stability, soil respiration, enzyme activity, active carbon, available organic nitrogen, and microbial community structure. In the field, prior to sampling, we will also perform an onsite soil health assessment using the Willamette Valley Soil Quality Card. This assessment is a more qualitative technique, but it is inexpensive and more practical for growers to use on their own fields. Overall, these data should provide information about how well the soil is providing ecosystem services (such as nutrient cycling) and supporting soil biota. 

This data set will consist almost entirely of spreadsheets of quantitative data. The Soil Quality Card will contain qualitative data (short descriptions, rating soil quality in different indicators). There will additionally be metadata associated with each site and sample, which will be descriptions of the site and environment. All of these data will be observational. 4.	The data will be collected according to the methods provided to us by the NRCS. Our data set will eventually be combined with data sets from other universities working on their regional projects, so it is important that all the research groups follow the same protocols. The lab measurements will be collected using the method and instrument in the table below. *Add table later*

# Roles and responsibilities

Soil sampling and data collection will be primarily carried out by me, with occasional assistance from an undergraduate research assistant. An NRCS representative will provide training on standardized soil collection and field description procedures, and will work collaboratively with myself and the PI to carry out sampling, prior to lab work. A second NRCS representative will provide standard lab methods to collect those data, and I will carry out the provided protocols. It will be my responsibility to check for instrument quality control and assurance, including routine maintenance. The PI will provide training/resources on appropriate maintenance and assurance on these particular machines. More serious repairs will be addressed by a specialist, and coordinated by the PI. 

I will be the data manager responsible for organization and short term storage of all lab results and field metadata. The undergraduate research assistant will be responsible for storing any data they collected in the same location (a shared folder on the OSU S: drive), format, and naming conventions as data collected by me. NRCS Representative 2 is responsible for organization of field soil health assessments, and for transferring them to NRCS Representative 1. I will work with NRCS Representative 1 to coordinate transfer of the lab and field data to their care for storage in the “USDA cloud vault”.  
Data analysis will be primarily performed by me, with assistance/supervision from the PI and consultation as needed with the OSU Statistics Consulting Service.

NRCS Representative 1 will also coordinate making the data publically available and discoverable after collection and analysis, via an online database. Preservation of the data will be carried out by NRCS technical experts, after it is turned over to NRCS Representative 1. It will be archived in a data repository, along with the data from the other projects.
