# Data description
Soil health is a holistic concept that encompasses a combination of several different dynamic soil properties (DSPs). The specific DSPs used vary among research groups, but we will be using those recommended by NRCS. In the lab, we will measure soil organic carbon, wet aggregate stability, soil respiration, enzyme activity, active carbon, available organic nitrogen, and microbial community structure. In the field, prior to sampling, we will also perform an onsite soil health assessment using the Willamette Valley Soil Quality Card. This assessment is a more qualitative technique, but it is inexpensive and more practical for growers to use on their own fields. Overall, these data should provide information about how well the soil is providing ecosystem services (such as nutrient cycling) and supporting soil biota. 

This data set consists almost entirely of spreadsheets of quantitative data. The Soil Quality Card will contain qualitative data (short descriptions, rating soil quality in different indicators). All of these data are observational. The data will be collected according to the methods provided to us by the NRCS. Our data set will eventually be combined with data sets from other universities working on their regional projects, so it is important that all the research groups follow the same protocols. 

# Roles and responsibilities

Soil sampling and data collection will be primarily carried out by me, with occasional assistance from an undergraduate research assistant. An NRCS representative will provide training on standardized soil collection and field description procedures, and will work collaboratively with myself and the PI to carry out sampling, prior to lab work. A second NRCS representative will provide standard lab methods to collect those data, and I will carry out the provided protocols. It will be my responsibility to check for instrument quality control and assurance, including routine maintenance. The PI will provide training/resources on appropriate maintenance and assurance on these particular machines. More serious repairs will be addressed by a specialist, and coordinated by the PI. 

I will be the data manager responsible for organization and short term storage of all lab results and field metadata. The undergraduate research assistant will be responsible for storing any data they collected in the same location (a shared folder on the OSU S: drive), format, and naming conventions as data collected by me. NRCS Representative 2 is responsible for organization of field soil health assessments, and for transferring them to NRCS Representative 1. I will work with NRCS Representative 1 to coordinate transfer of the lab and field data to their care for storage in the “USDA cloud vault”.  
Data analysis will be primarily performed by me, with assistance/supervision from the PI and consultation as needed with the OSU Statistics Consulting Service.

NRCS Representative 1 will also coordinate making the data publically available and discoverable after collection and analysis, via an online database. Preservation of the data will be carried out by NRCS technical experts, after it is turned over to NRCS Representative 1. It will be archived in a data repository, along with the data from the other projects.

# Data standards and metadata

All of my data will be numerical measurements recorded in spreadsheets, most of which will be generated by lab tests. I plan to use .csv files for the quantitative data.  

During the collection and analysis phase, data will be stored in three places and updated daily with an automatic backup system. 
1. On my local computer at Oregon State (working copy).  
2. On the shared drive hosted by my department (master copy and original raw data)  
3. On an institutional folder on Box (master copy) 

Following initial analysis, data will also be stored on the USDA Cloud server

All data sets will be described with the following metadata categories, based on the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) Guidelines (http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/deposit/supportingDocumentation). 

* Contact information for project members at OSU and NRCS. Orcid numbers will be provided where available. 
* A brief description of the data being described  
* Experimental design/sampling regime (including sample plot GPS location and site description information)  
* Collection Methods  
* Fieldwork and/or laboratory instrumentation  
   + Calibration steps and values  
   + Quality control and assurance methods  
* Nature and units of recorded values (including corresponding column names, units, definitions)  
* Analytical Methods (statistical analysis, calculations)  
* Details of data structure (how data is organized into different files and folders)
